This folder contains the new "ground up" code for VEP testing,
created by the Backus Lab. This code is supposed to be well
documented and without many kludges. It makes use of Jens Kremkow's
code for synchronizing the start of a visual stimulus trial and
start of VEP recording with the fixation "GO" signal constructed
by the Plexon CPU in the VEP rig, but otherwise it's mostly new and
supposedly more transparent (at least to the Backus Lab, who know
what it does because they wrote it).

Please do not put undocumented code into this folder. Everything
in here should be written in such a way that another person looking
at it can know what it does. See existing code for examples of 
commenting. 

In particular:

  Put a comment at the start of each block of code saying how and what it does.
  Say what variables and structures are and what their dimensions are.
